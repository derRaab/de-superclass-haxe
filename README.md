# de-superclass-haxe
Open source library with some nice haxe utilities.

Since I'm using and loving http://haxe.org/ for a couple of years already, I'd love to share some of my personal software utilities I developed for our convienience at work. So this repository will grow while I'm moving classes from an private git to this open source git.

Feel free to use whatever you like and I'd love to get any feedback and I'm happy to fix any issues.
